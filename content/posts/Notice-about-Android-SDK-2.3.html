		Hello Everyone,
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, Google released SDK 2.3 which provides support for Gingerbread. Information about support for this SDK is described on the MOTODEV Studio discussion boards. Stay tuned to the MOTODEV Studio Blog RSS feed for more details.

	<hr />
	<p>
		Today, Google released a new SDK for Android 2.3 (aka "Gingerbread"). Like most of you, we've been waiting for this release because it means exciting new APIs and features for all of us to use. Like many of the previous SDK releases, 2.3 has a new ADT plugins. We've been seeing checkins to the open source repository and have been testing MOTODEV Studio against that code. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The new SDK has a change to the layout of the platforms directory so that some of the tools that used to be in the 'tools' directory are now in level-specific folders within the platform folder. For developers, this means that plugins and build tools prior to this release are not compatible with this release and vice-versa. You MUST update the tools and the SDK at the same time or your build processes will fail. That is the case whether you are using MOTODEV Studio, Eclipse, or a command line. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We've been building and testing MOTODEV Studio for several weeks with the code that was checked into the AOSP repos, but we want to make certain everything still works with the released SDK. I anticipate that we will have an update site that has the new plugins and works with the 2.3 SDK early next week. Check back on the discussion boards often or just check the RSS view inside MOTODEV Studio for updates via the MOTODEV Studio Blog. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to play with the features of the SDK, you can download it to a separate location of your drive. If you want to use it in the IDE, you can download Eclipse and manually install the ADT plugins and the SDK until we activate our update site. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio and best wishes for success in 2011.
