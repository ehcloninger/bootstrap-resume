		Hello MOTODEV Studio users, 
	</p>
	<p>
		A new version of MOTODEV Studio for Android became available on Monday, February 28, 2011. This update provides support for Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) SDK and includes version 10 of the Google ADT plugins. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A longer description of the update and how to install it is available on the MOTODEV discussion boards at <em>http://community.developer.motorola.com/t5/MOTODEV-Studio-for-Android/ANN-MOTODEV-Studio-2-1-1-is-av...</em> 
	</p>
	<p>
		Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio for Android.

		Hello everyone! 
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm pleased to announce that MOTODEV Studio 2.1.1 is available now. This update has the latest ADT plugins that support the Honeycomb SDK. If you have already manually installed ADT version 10 from the Google site and updated your Android SDK using the Android SDK and AVD Manager, then this update for MOTODEV Studio isn't required. If you are still running the Gingerbread SDK with ADT version 9, then you may want to apply this update at your convenience. 
	</p>
	<p>
		There are no major bugs fixed in this update, just support for the Honeycomb SDK and ADT 10. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You can update MOTODEV Studio with "Help->Check for Updates". This will update over the Internet. You can also download the Helios update package from our downloads site and manually apply the update as a local archive. Finally, you could download the full installer for version 2.1.1. All three methods will get you to the same point. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you choose to use "Help->Check for Updates", be aware that we've been having problems for weeks communicating with the eclipse.org servers. It may take 2 or 3 repeated attempts to get all the packages downloaded. This is an Eclipse issue and not unique to MOTODEV Studio. This is why we suggest getting the update package for Helios and manually applying it to your installation. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have problems with the installer or update, please post to this thread. It would help to know what OS you are running and any details about the messages you are seeing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio.
