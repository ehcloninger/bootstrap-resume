		Hello everyone, 
	</p>
	<p>
		On February 22, Google released the final Honeycomb 3.0 SDK along with new ADT plugins for Eclipse. We've tested these items and they appear to work correctly. News about the changes and instructions on how to work with them are <em>in this thread at the MOTODEV Studio discussion boards</em> . 
	</p>
	<p>
		Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio. 
	</p>

		Hello everyone, 
	</p>
	<p>
		Today Google released the Honeycomb (3.0) SDK for Android. This release also has a set of ADT plugins for Eclipse. We've not had a chance to go through a full set of regression tests, but we did anticipate this SDK when we released MOTODEV Studio 2.1 a few weeks ago. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you can wait a few days for us to go through these plugins and pronounce them clear, that would be best. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But, I know everyone is excited to start developing for XOOM. So here goes... 
	</p>
	<p>
		You should be able to download the SDK with the Android SDK and AVD Manager tool. You can then use the update instructions for the ADT plugins that are found at http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html#installing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		After I was able to install the SDK and ADT plugins, I was able to create an AVD and then change an existing project to target the 3.0 SDK. So far, so good, but there are a lot of other test cases to run. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I'll make another post tomorrow (Wednesday evening, Central US time) with an update on the results of our more detailed testing.
