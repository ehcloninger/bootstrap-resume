		<strong>NOTE: </strong>This blog post was originally hosted on Motorola's MOTODEV web site. That site was decommissioned in 2012. I've made every attempt to preserve blog posts and accompanying forum posts with their original content. Many web links are no longer valid, so they have been removed and replaced with <em>emphasized</em> text.

		Hello everyone,

		Hello everyone! 
	</p>
	<p>
		I hope you are enjoying the World Cup as much as we are. There's a lot happening these days and it's not just football that has us excited. The announcement of the Droid X by Motorola on June 23 is part of the massive movement toward Android. When paired with the exciting new features in Froyo, it's a great time to be developing mobile apps. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Motorola Developer program (MOTODEV) is on top of these new releases with tutorials, new tools, and specifications. Our goal is to reduce the barriers that slow you down, so that you can write great applications. As the Product Manager for MOTODEV Studio for Android, I'm always looking for things that we can do to make your lives easier whether it's creating new features in the tools or writing sample code. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, I'm happy to announce that we've created a MOTODEV Studio for Android video playlist on YouTube. In this playlist, I demonstrate features in MOTODEV Studio. I have more videos under production and I will publish them to the video playlist every few weeks. As new videos are available, I'll make a short post to the MOTODEV Studio blog with the links. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Watch the videos now:

		Thank you for your interest in MOTODEV Studio for Android. For the latest announcements on Studio, please visit our blog.

		P.S. For added enjoyment or if I get boring, click on the football for vuvuzela sound effects (while the World Cup lasts or until Google removes that feature).
